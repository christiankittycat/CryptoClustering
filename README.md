Crypto Clustering Project

This project focuses on clustering cryptocurrencies based on their market performance. Utilizing a dataset of various cryptocurrency market data, we apply machine learning techniques to analyze and group similar cryptocurrencies. The crypto_market_data.csv file contains the market data used for this analysis, including features such as price, volume, and market capitalization. The goal is to identify patterns and relationships within the data that can provide insights into the cryptocurrency market.

The Crypto_Clustering_starter_code.ipynb notebook contains the code to preprocess the data, implement clustering algorithms, and visualize the results. It walks through the process of scaling the data, applying clustering techniques such as K-means, and evaluating the clusters formed. By following the steps outlined in the notebook, users can replicate the analysis and explore the clustering of cryptocurrencies. This project is intended to provide a foundation for further exploration and analysis of cryptocurrency market behavior.
